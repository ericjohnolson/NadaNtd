Redistricting:

I want to be able to see all my original districts and original data entry. Why? How easily?
I want to be able to enter historical information into districts that no longer exist. Why?
I want to be able to view only existing districts after the redistricting to reduce confusion. Why?


**** What are the purposes of this feature (e.g. to easily fill out the TAS)? Please be as specific as possible.

NTD control board: apples to apples. 2 rounds of MDA, but the parent is 5 rounds MDA.

1. Track the total numberof districts treated overtime, shows more even though just redistricting... Geographic coverage. 
2. Track the performance in a given district overtime, specific district, you want to know performance over time. How many rounds have the district had, how many people were treated, etc. Identify areas with historically low coverage. 

------
Can go back in history, or not...

- use old district demarcation or new demarcation. desire to have both.  OMG.

2b. note in terminology: we use parent/mother district >> new district is daughter/child
3. intv performance track endemicity over time. if mapping was done in the parent district, how does that affect the endemicity with the daughter district. since it is part of it, we need to capture disease endemicity over time. 

4. ToT discussion: want to know how the situation was at the actual time of implementation.

5. recognizing that redistricting ocurred, understand how all districts relate.

6. HOW DO WE ENTER HISTORICAL DATA, 2006 data, in 2014 how do we enter that data.

---------------------

*** Would users want to see original districts and data (before redistricting occurred)? Which data? Why?

*** What information about original districts should be visible in the new district (e.g. old district name)? Why? What different scenarios are possible? e.g.

- entering data using the new, don't need to know old...
- Old name and year redistricting occured.... REPORTS should have this.

!!!- During reporting ability to see old district or new districts, and see year and event of redistricting
!!!- Report of how of old districts map to new districts 


What information should appear on a historical report (before redistricting occurred)?
- What if a report spans both before and after redistricting? What info would you expect to see?

- old vs new option on reports
- event of redistricting on reports

What if a report includes dates only after redistricting? What info would you expect to see?
- column first

- Time consuming to write out rules
- Don't want to make the decisions all by myself...
